# Dotfiles 

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files for various applications. These files are used to customize the behavior and appearance of my development environment. 

Also, I have included a script to automate the setup of my development environment on new machines. This script will install necessary packages, set up symbolic links for the dotfiles, and configure the system according to my preferences.  

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianLeon1/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```
